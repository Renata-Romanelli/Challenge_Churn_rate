# Alura Voz: Data Science Challenge

Alura's Data Science Challenge to develop a set of supervised machine learning analyzes and models to help Alura Voz's sales team build customer loyalty.

Alura Voz is a telecommunications company that hired us to act as data scientists on the sales team. We need to carry out a study on the company's Churn. Churn indicates whether or not a customer has canceled their contract with the company, and helps us understand the company's bottom line.

The work will be divided into 4 weeks:

- Week 1: Understanding the data
- Week 2: Data Visualization
- Week 3 and 4: Training and Validation of Machine Learning Models

Note: The view of .ipynb files by github does not include the visualization of certain libraries like "plotly" and "Pandas Profiling". It is recommended that files be viewed via google colab
